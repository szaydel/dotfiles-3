"""Claude Code hook: keep the active claude-swap account on the
primary (asmeurer@gmail.com) and bridge to the fallback
(aaronmeurer@gmail.com) only when the primary's 5-hour budget is about to
run dry.

SOURCE_EMAIL is the *primary* account; TARGET_EMAIL is the fallback. Both
decisions are driven off a single ``claude-swap --list --json`` call, which
reports each account's 5-hour and 7-day usage windows (the used percentage
plus the fixed ``resetsAt`` timestamp for each).

The 5-hour window is a rolling budget with a *fixed* reset time: it can be
spent to 100% hours before it resets, and when it is, ``usageStatus`` still
reads "ok" (that field tracks the weekly/overall state, not the 5-hour
wall). So neither the reset clock nor usageStatus is a usable "about to be
walled" signal. Instead we use the same burn-rate projection the status line
shows -- projected minutes until the 5-hour budget hits 100% at the average
rate since the window opened:

  * Switch AWAY (primary -> fallback) when that projection drops under
    AWAY_PROJECTED_EMPTY_MINUTES minutes (about to run dry), when the 5-hour
    window's free headroom falls to AWAY_MIN_FREE_PCT regardless of what the
    projection says, OR whenever the primary's usageStatus is not "ok"
    (already walled, e.g. weekly cap). The absolute floor exists because the
    projection is an *average* over the window: a burst late in a mostly-idle
    window empties the budget far faster than the average predicts, and the
    average keeps reporting a comfortable margin right up to the wall.

  * Switch BACK (fallback -> primary) once the primary's 5-hour window
    has reset. The main, fetch-independent signal is wall-clock time: the
    5-hour ``resetsAt`` is a fixed timestamp, recorded when we switch away,
    so once ``now`` passes it the window has definitely reset -- no need to
    re-fetch the primary's usage, which as the *inactive* account is often
    "unavailable" (its usage-API token gets rate-limited). A secondary signal
    still fires when the inactive usage *is* fetchable and its 5-hour free
    headroom has jumped back to RETURN_FRESH_FREE_PCT. Either triggers the
    return; we hold only if we can positively see the weekly window is walled.

    Note this returns as soon as the primary is usable, *not* when the
    fallback runs low -- in the typical case the fallback still has plenty of
    headroom left when we switch back. That is deliberate: the fallback is a
    bridge across the primary's 5-hour gap, and the primary is the account we
    want to be on whenever it is available.

Fable has its own, separate budget: a per-model *weekly* bucket that the usage
API reports as a named ``scoped`` window (``usage.scoped[] .name == "Fable"``)
and that claude-swap passes through in --list --json. It is spent independently
of the 5-hour and 7-day windows, so the primary can sit at 5% Fable free while
its 5-hour window is barely touched. Three things follow, and each is why the
Fable rule is *not* a copy of the 5-hour rule:

  * Trigger on a plain free-% floor (FABLE_AWAY_MIN_FREE_PCT), never on a
    burn-rate projection. The bucket resets with the 7-day window, so the
    projection would say "won't last the week" days early -- and acting on it
    would park us on the fallback for those days.

  * Only when Fable is actually the model in use. The hook payload does not
    carry the model, so each invocation reads the tail of its session's
    transcript (``transcript_path``) and stamps ``fable_last_seen_ts`` in the
    state file from the latest main-session assistant entry, or from genuinely
    recent sidechain Fable entries. Any session's stamp counts, for
    FABLE_ACTIVE_WINDOW_SECONDS -- the accounts are global, and the throttle
    means the session that happens to win the 60-second race is often not the
    one running Fable.

    A *refused* request counts as use too, and this is not an edge case: when
    the bucket is already empty the request never reaches a model, so the
    transcript gets a ``<synthetic>`` "out of usage credits ... Fable" entry and
    no ``claude-fable-5`` entry at all. A session that starts on Fable while
    walled would otherwise be invisible to the rule that exists for it. That
    refusal also stamps ``fable_walled_ts`` with the active account, which
    forces the away rule only when the primary produced the refusal. It is
    ground truth from the API, while the percentage comes from a snapshot up to
    ~3 minutes stale.

  * Only when the fallback can actually serve Fable (usageStatus not limiting,
    and its own Fable bucket above FABLE_TARGET_MIN_FREE_PCT). A Fable-spent
    primary is still perfectly good for Opus/Sonnet, so unlike the 5-hour wall
    -- which makes the account useless for everything -- leaving pays only if
    the destination has Fable to spend. When that check refuses (the fallback
    needs a re-login, say) the hook raises a desktop notification at most every
    BLOCKED_NOTIFY_INTERVAL_SECONDS: from the outside this case is
    indistinguishable from the hook being broken, so it must not be silent.

  The return side needs the mirror of that rule, or the two oscillate: the
  5-hour signal says "primary is fine, go back", the Fable rule says "primary
  is spent, leave" and we bounce every check. So while Fable is in use we HOLD
  on the fallback whenever the primary's Fable bucket is still spent -- read
  live when the primary's usage is fetchable, otherwise from the
  ``pending_fable_reset_at`` recorded on the way out. A Fable-only departure can
  return after MIN_SWITCH_INTERVAL_SECONDS once Fable is no longer active;
  otherwise the unrelated 5-hour reset would strand the fallback for hours.
  MIN_SWITCH_INTERVAL_SECONDS is a backstop under all of this: no two switches
  closer together than that (except an outright usageStatus wall, which must not
  wait).

  Not handled, because there is nowhere to go: the *fallback* running out of
  Fable while we are on it. With two accounts that is simply the end of Fable
  for the week; the hook keeps the return-to-primary behavior it always had.

Caveats: the usage snapshot behind every decision is served from claude-swap's
store with a 180-second freshness floor (poll_policy.SERVE_TTL_S), dropping to
~60s for the active account while it is visibly burning toward a limit -- so
even a fresh read can be a few minutes behind reality. AWAY_PROJECTED_EMPTY_MINUTES
and AWAY_MIN_FREE_PCT are both margin against that staleness plus a burst.

Wired in ~/.claude/settings.json on:

  * PostToolUse   -- fires after every tool call, so a long turn that never
                     reaches a Stop still gets evaluated. This is the trigger
                     that matters: turn-boundary-only hooks can go hours
                     without firing while the budget drains inside one turn.
  * Stop, StopFailure, SubagentStop, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact -- turn and
    session boundaries, including the failure path (a turn that walls the
    account mid-response never cleanly Stops, but does StopFailure).

Because PostToolUse fires per tool call, CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS throttles the
actual work: invocations inside that window exit silently without running
claude-swap or writing a log line. The throttle clock is the mtime of
THROTTLE_PATH; a nonblocking process lock serializes that throttle decision
with switch-state mutation so concurrent sessions cannot duplicate a switch or
race while reading/writing STATE_PATH.

A mid-turn switch does take effect on the running session -- claude-swap
rewrites ~/.claude/.credentials.json on every switch specifically to bump its
mtime and force Claude Code to drop its memoized OAuth token (see
claude_swap/credentials.py::_write_oauth_credentials). No restart needed;
worst case the running session takes ~30s (the macOS Keychain cache TTL) to
pick up the new account.

Always exits 0 on expected conditions so it never blocks a turn; unexpected
errors are allowed to surface as a traceback.

TO TURN THIS OFF: set ENABLED = False below (one line, tracked in dotfiles).
That is the switch to flip once the fallback account goes away. Nothing else
needs undoing -- the hook then no-ops on every turn, and the status line's
"↩ asmeurer N% free" note self-disables because it only renders while the
fallback account is the active one. For a temporary, per-shell disable
instead, export CLAUDE_AUTO_SWAP_DISABLED=1.
